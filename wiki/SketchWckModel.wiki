#summary Modeling the Robobuilder wck servo in Sketchup with sketchy physics

= Introduction =

Initial proof of concept

This create a two servo pan and tilt style head. One servo is model as a hinge, the other as a servo. The wck model itself is a component.

Requires Google Sketchup 7 (free download) from here:

And SketchyPhysics plugin from here:

= Details =

Example of it running. The servos are controlled by the slider bars that appear when the model is run (press green triangle)
