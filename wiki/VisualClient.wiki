#summary Visual Client (windows forms based applications)

= Introduction =

The visual client application works as a complete UI front end to the robobuilderlib software (or using PC direct mode) to the default software (firmware 2.23 and above - some features don't work on earlier versions). 

The visual client provides 
  * motion capture and editing software, 
  * user defined motion control (using L# embedded), 
  * a 3D visualisation using Physx and 
  * web cam interaction with object detection (based n colour filters)
