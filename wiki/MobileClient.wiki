#summary Details of Windows Mobile 6 client

= Introduction =


Default mode - Works with standard firmware. Select either Connect or quit menu options. On connect it will display serial number and firmware version if successful and a graphic of a game controller appears. Pressing numbers 0-9 will cause the robot to perform the appropriate motion/action. This mode use PCRemote built against compact .Net framework and send binary protocol to the robot.

If you press 'b' before connecting it switches to basic mode, and the controller simply send the corresponding IR character value directly to the robot. Again no use for standard firmware - but this can be used in custom application firmware (or basic programs)

If you press 't' before connecting it will switch into Terminal mode - and then you can get a very basic VT100 terminal emulator so you can interact with your robot. This won't work with standard firmware - but is great if you're running Basic for instance.
