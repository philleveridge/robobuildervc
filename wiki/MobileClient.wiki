#summary Details of Windows Mobile 6 client

= Introduction =

For those without the latest in phone technology there is hope!

The applications has three modes

  * Default mode - Works with standard firmware. Select either Connect or quit menu options. On connect it will display serial number and firmware version if successful and a graphic of a game controller appears. (see above image) Pressing numbers 0-9 will cause the robot to perform the appropriate motion/action. 

||Button Mapping||Motion||
||0||Get Up A||
||1||Turn Right ||
||2||Forward ||
||3||Attack Left ||
||4||Left ||
||5||Attack Right ||
||6||Right ||
||7||Turn Left ||
||8||Back ||
||9||stand||

  * Basic Mode - Press 'b' before connecting it switches to basic mode, and the controller simply send the corresponding IR character value directly to the robot. Again no use for standard firmware - but this can be used in custom application firmware (or basic programs)

  * Terminal Mode - Press 't' before connecting it will switch into Terminal mode - and then you can get a very basic VT100 terminal emulator so you can interact with your robot. This won't work with standard firmware - but is great if you're running Basic for instance.

== How it works ==

The code should work with any Windows Mobile 6 phone (or 6.5) but I have tested on my [http://www.htc.com/uk/product/s620/overview.html S620 HTC "Smartphone"] circa 2007.

The [http://robobuildervc.googlecode.com/files/RomoMoboApps.zip source] requires Visual Studio 2005 professional edition to build. [The free express editions won't work as they don't support mobile devices (why MS why ?)]

The code relies on the phone OS to map the BlueTooth to a serial port when it connects and hence the code uses the RobobuilderLib library to read and write to COM port 6. The code uses PCRemote class re-built against Compact .Net V2 framework to send binary protocol to the robot. 

When the application connects to the Robobuilder for the first time its asks for a PIN - after some digging I found its set to 1234. Worth knowing!
